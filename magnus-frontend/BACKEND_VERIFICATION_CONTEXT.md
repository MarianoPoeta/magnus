# üîç Backend Verification Context - Party Budget Bliss

## üéØ Document Purpose
This document provides comprehensive context for AI agents to verify if the generated JHipster backend implementation fulfills all architectural, functional, and technical requirements for the Party Budget Bliss application.

## üìã Application Overview

### **Core Purpose**
Sophisticated event management system with automated workflow generation, real-time task synchronization, and intelligent resource planning across multiple user roles.

### **Technology Stack Requirements**
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot (JHipster generated)
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+ (Production) / H2 (Development)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Real-time Communication**: Spring WebSocket
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization

### **User Role System**
1. **ADMIN** - Full system access, configuration, user management
2. **SALES** - Budget creation, client management, proposal generation
3. **LOGISTICS** - Task management, shopping coordination, transportation
4. **COOK** - Cooking schedules, ingredient management, menu planning

## üèóÔ∏è Core Entity Requirements

```

## üîÑ Critical Workflow Requirements

### **Automatic Task Generation**
**Trigger**: Budget status changes to "RESERVA"
**Actions Required**:
1. Generate shopping tasks (2-7 days before event, assigned to LOGISTICS)
2. Generate cooking tasks (day of event, assigned to COOK)
3. Generate delivery/setup tasks (day of event, assigned to LOGISTICS)
4. Create task dependencies (shopping blocks cooking, etc.)
5. Calculate optimal timing based on event date
6. Send role-based notifications

### **Shopping List Consolidation**
**Business Logic**:
1. Group products by name, unit, category across multiple budgets
2. Calculate total quantities needed for the week
3. Track purchase progress with partial purchase support
4. Auto-update when cook modifies ingredient requirements
5. Generate consolidated shopping lists by week

### **Real-Time Synchronization Requirements**
**Cook ‚Üî Logistics Sync**:
1. Cook modifies cooking ingredient ‚Üí Auto-update shopping list
2. Logistics purchases item ‚Üí Notify cook of ingredient availability
3. Task status changes ‚Üí Real-time updates across all users
4. Conflict detection for simultaneous modifications

}
```

## üîê Security and Access Control

### **Role-Based Permissions Matrix**
| Resource | ADMIN | SALES | LOGISTICS | COOK |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------|------|
| Budgets | CRUD | CRUD | Read | Read |
| Tasks | CRUD | Read | CRUD (logistics tasks) | CRUD (cooking tasks) |
| Shopping | CRUD | Read | CRUD | Read |
| Cooking | CRUD | Read | Read | CRUD |
| Templates | CRUD | Read | Read | CRUD (menus only) |
| Users | CRUD | - | - | - |
| Config | CRUD | - | - | - |

### **Data Filtering Requirements**
- **SALES**: Only see budgets they created
- **LOGISTICS**: Only see approved budgets (status = RESERVA) and assigned tasks
- **COOK**: Only see cooking-related tasks and schedules
- **Cross-Role Data**: Shopping lists visible to both LOGISTICS and COOK

### **Authentication Requirements**
- JWT-based authentication with role claims
- Session management with token refresh
- Role-based route protection
- API endpoint security based on user role

## üìä Performance Requirements

### **Database Indexing Strategy**
```sql
-- Critical indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_budgets_status_date ON budgets(status, event_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_role_status ON tasks(assigned_to_role, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_shopping_week ON shopping_items(week_start, week_end);
CREATE INDEX idx_cooking_date ON cooking_schedules(event_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_entity_time ON audit_logs(entity_type, timestamp);
```

### **Caching Requirements**
- **Templates**: 1-hour cache (rarely change)
- **Shopping Lists**: 15-minute cache (frequent updates)
- **Task Lists**: 5-minute cache (real-time critical)
- **Dashboard Analytics**: 30-minute cache
- **User Profiles**: 24-hour cache

### **Performance Targets**
- API Response Time: < 200ms for CRUD operations
- WebSocket Message Delivery: < 100ms
- Database Query Time: < 50ms for indexed queries
- Workflow Trigger Processing: < 2 seconds
- Shopping Consolidation: < 5 seconds for weekly aggregation
